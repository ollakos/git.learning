Said baby, said baby, said baby

What you doing? (What you doing?)
Where you at? (Where you at?)
Oh, you got plans? (You got plans?)
Don't say that
I'm sipping wine (sip, sip) in a robe (drip, drip)
I look too good (look too good) to be alone (woo-woo)
My house clean (house clean), my pool warm (pool warm)
Just shaved (smooth like a newborn)
We should be dancing, romancing
In the east wing and the west wing
Of this mansion, what's happening?
